Once the blockchain network has been brought up and the chaincode has been successfully commited, one can run the following command to start the application.

```
cd application-gateway-VPPO
go run application-gateway-VPPO.go
```

or 

```
cd application-gateway-DER
go run application-gateway-DER.go
```
